\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}
\begin{rSubsection}{\large Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, Bengaluru}{\textbf{\large Aug 2019 - present}}{\large Senior Data Scientist}{}

 \item Part of the global team at Bosch responsible for incorporating Artificial Intelligence into Bosch products and processes.\\\\
%{\bf Automated Commissioned Air Leakage Detection}
{\textbf{\textit{Automated Air Leakage Detection}}}
 \item Built and deployed a \textbf{Random Forest} based automated air leakage detection algorithm for the manufacturing plants at BSH Hausger√§te GmbH.
 \item Worked with ultra sound data and engineered features using techniques like \textbf{Fourier Transforms, Power Spectral Density, Kurtosis, Skewness} etc. which resulted in a model accuracy of \textbf{99.2\%}.
 \item The fully developed solution (hardware \& software) has an estimated target market of \textbf{180 Mn \euro{}}.\\\\
%{\bf Vivalytic - Automated Spot Detection Algorithm}
{\textbf{\textit{Vivalytic - Automated Spot Detection Algorithm}}}
 \item Vivalytic is a universal platform for molecular diagnostics that can analyze sample materials in a fully automated way via designated cartridges, the result being indicated in the form of fluorescent spots.
 \item Built a \textbf{CNN} based spot detection algorithm which has been deployed in the Vivalytic platform.
 \item Experimented with various techniques like \textbf{Dynamic Drop-out \& Cross Validation} to improve the model performance and robustness, achieved an overall accuracy of \textbf{99.77\%}.
 \item Forecasted sales revenue of the platform by 2025 is more than \textbf{250 Mn \euro{}}.\\\\
{\textbf{\textit{Machinery Spare Part Inventory Optimization}}}
 \item Developed and deployed a fully automated solution for spare part stock inventory planning in manufacturing plants of Bosch's Power Train Solutions division.
  \item Employed \textbf{probabilistic techniques} like \textbf{reorder point } and \textbf{economic order quantity} models, thereby ensuring timely availability of spare parts and avoiding production shut downs.
  \item Built and integrated an \textbf{outlier detection} engine into the above solution which generates alerts for parts having anomalous consumption patterns.
 \item The solution has been deployed for usage in \textbf{16 manufacturing plants across Europe} accounting for an annual inventory savings of \textbf{3 Mn \euro{}}.\\\\
%{\bf Electric Car Battery Aging Prediction}
{\textbf{\textit{Electric Car Battery Aging Prediction}}}
 \item Built a \textbf{Gaussian Process} based model to improve the robustness and accuracy of the state of health estimation of EV batteries. 
 \item Worked with battery aging data containing electro-chemical parameters, temperature, voltage, charging \& discharge current related information. Employed multiple data augmentation techniques like \textbf{Jittering, Warping, Pattern Mixing} etc. to handle data scarcity.
 \item Forecasted sales revenue of the platform by 2025 is \textbf{104 Mn \euro{}} with the AI solution contributing \textbf{1\%}.\\\\
{\textbf{\textit{Miscellaneous}}}
 \item Represented Bosch at the \textbf{campus recruitment} events of multiple top-tier Indian universities to setup a best-in-class Artificial Intelligence team for Bosch in India.
 \item Conceptualized and implemented a company wide initiative "\textbf{Prod-casts}" in order to improve the awareness of Artificial Intelligence among Boschlers.\\
