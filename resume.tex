\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}
\begin{rSubsection}{Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, Bengaluru}{\textbf{Aug 2019 - present}}{Senior Data Scientist}{}

 \item Part of the global team at Bosch responsible for incorporating Artificial Intelligence into Bosch products and processes.\\\\
%{\bf Automated Commissioned Air Leakage Detection}
{\textbf{\textit{Automated Air Leakage Detection}}}
 \item Built and deployed a Random Forest based automated air leakage detection algorithm for the manufacturing plants at BSH Hausger√§te GmbH.
 \item Worked with ultra sound data and engineered features using techniques like Fourier Transforms, Power Spectral Density, Kurtosis, Skewness etc. which resulted in a model accuracy of 99.2\%.
 \item The fully developed solution (hardware \& software) has an estimated target market of 180 Mn \euro{}.\\\\
%{\bf Vivalytic - Automated Spot Detection Algorithm}
{\textbf{\textit{Vivalytic - Automated Spot Detection Algorithm}}}
 \item Vivalytic is a universal platform for molecular diagnostics that can analyze sample materials in a fully automated way via designated cartridges, the result being indicated in the form of fluorescent spots.
 \item Built a CNN based spot detection algorithm which has been deployed in the Vivalytic platform.
 \item Experimented with various techniques like Dynamic Drop-out \& Cross Validation to improve the model performance and robustness, achieved an overall accuracy of 99.77\%.
 \item Forecasted sales revenue of the platform by 2025 is more than 250 Mn \euro{}.\\\\
{\textbf{\textit{Machinery Spare Part Inventory Optimization}}}
 \item Developed and deployed a fully automated solution for spare part stock inventory planning in manufacturing plants of Bosch's Power Train Solutions division.
  \item Employed probabilistic techniques like reorder point and economic order quantity models, thereby ensuring timely availability of spare parts and avoiding production shut downs.
  \item Built and integrated an outlier detection engine into the above solution which generates alerts for parts having anomalous consumption patterns.
 \item The solution has been deployed for usage in 16 manufacturing plants across Europe accounting for an annual inventory savings of 3 Mn \euro{}.\\\\
%{\bf Electric Car Battery Aging Prediction}
{\textbf{\textit{Electric Car Battery Aging Prediction}}}
 \item Built a Gaussian Process based model to improve the robustness and accuracy of the state of health estimation of EV batteries.
 \item Worked with battery aging data containing electro-chemical parameters, temperature, voltage, charging \& discharge current related information.
 \item Forecasted sales revenue of the platform by 2025 is 104 Mn \euro{} with the AI solution contributing 1\%.\\\\
{\textbf{\textit{Miscellaneous}}}
 \item Represented Bosch at the campus recruitment events of multiple top-tier Indian universities to setup a best-in-class Artificial Intelligence team for Bosch in India.
 \item Conceptualized and implemented a company wide initiative "Prod-casts" in order to improve the awareness of Artificial Intelligence among Boschlers.\\
